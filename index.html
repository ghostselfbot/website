                            <p>Ghost started out as Bennyware, my first introduction to creating selfbots and Discord tools. This began to build popularity within the community but at the time it was invite only. I then decided to replace Bennyware with my new selfbot, Ghost. I started it out as invite only and completely free. I had a few people in my friend group start the community and I would drop invite keys every week. Ghost then became quite popular and a lot more people wanted to get on board. After some thought, I then made Ghost open to the public with keys being purchaseable.</p>
                            <p>Ghost went on to become part of some of the most successful selfbots and was well known around the community. I had built up quite a reputation and with frequent updates it just kept growing.</p>
                            <div id="about-more" style="display: none;">
                                <p>Unfortunately, this is where it all went down hill… Someone either inside or outside the community, decided to spam Nighty’s API saying “download ghost” or something similar. At the time, I was part of Nighty’s community and had previously bought a key in 2021. Ghost’s security was incredibly flawed due to my lack of experience. HWIDs were checked by grabbing a list of HWIDs and UIDs. The bot, client side, then checked whether the HWID was in this list. Yes I know, client side… This allowed Nighty to spoof the HTTP requests and make Ghost free to use. One of Nighty’s developers, then posted in the announcements channel about this, leaked my real name and also Ghost.</p>
                                <p>I panicked and dropped the source to Ghost in Ghost’s server and left. This then stirred up a lot of controversy. I decided to quit the community and focus on my life outside of Discord and the computer. I’m really glad I did this as I am now a lot happier! </p>
                                <p>Over the few years I was gone, I was still messing about with Discord and creating new tools and selfbots. One of which was this rewrite of Ghost. Rather than one single file and crappy security, the rewrite is written with the latest version of discord.py-self and uses cogs and custom utils to keep the code clean and snappy. Recently, I found my passion for the project again and have added newer features like a GUI and last year I created an image embed utility, making Ghost one of the most feature rich open source selfbots out there!</p>
                                <p>Hopefully, for the next year or two, I’ll keep the spark alive and gradually update Ghost. This will be slow as I’m currently studying at University.</p>
                                <p>Here’s to another year of Ghost!</p>
